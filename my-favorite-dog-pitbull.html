<h1>Pitbull</h1>
<h2>It's time to learn, about the great pitbull</h2>

<p class="intro">This is an introduction, to the history of the pitbull</p>


<p>Pitbull is the common namefor a type of dog. Formal breeds often considered in North America
to be of the pitbull type include American Pitbull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully
, and Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The American Bulldog is also sometimes included.
Many of these breeds were originally delveloped as fighting dogs from cross breeding
bull-baiting dogs (used to hold the faces and heads of larger animals such as bulls)
and terriers. After the use of dogs in blood sports was banned, such dogs were used
as catch dogs in the United States for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt and drive livestock, and as family companions
. Despite dog fighting now being illegal in the United States, it still exists as an underground activity,
and pit bulls are a common breed of choice. The term pit bull is often used loosely to describe dogs with similar physical
characteristcs, and the morphological (physical) variation amongst "bully breed" dogs make it difficult for anyone,
even experts, to visually indentify them as distinct from "non-pit bulls".</p>

<p>Violent interactions between humans and canines have been studied by the US goverment, notably the Center for Disease Control and Prevention,
as well as academic veterinary researchers. The interpretation of these studies, breed indentification and relevance issues,
and variable circumstances have given rise to intense controversy.</p>
